# Fluid2d
Fluid2d is a versatile Python-Fortran CFD code that solves a large
class of 2D flows. It is designed to be used easily by Students
learning Fluid Mechanics or Geophysical Fluid Dynamics and by their
professors willing to illustrate their course and to organize
numerical practicals. The idea is to visualize flows on the fly, as
they are computed. The effect of parameter changes can be seen
immediately. The key quantity of fluid2D is the vorticity. If you feel
weak on vorticity dynamics, this code is for you. You should rapidly
become as expert as the experts.

You can learn how basic processes work because of the power of
animations. It is quite easy to go beyond textbooks and to reach
research questions.
